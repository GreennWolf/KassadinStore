# Stock Decrement System Analysis

## Current Implementation

The system for decrementing stock of unranked accounts is implemented in two main places:

1. **purchase controller** (`purcharseController.js`):
   - When a purchase status is changed to "Completed", the system identifies unranked accounts
   - The stock is decremented by the purchase quantity
   - If stock reaches 0, the account is marked as inactive

2. **unranked controller** (`unrankedController.js`):
   - Contains a dedicated endpoint for manually updating stock: `update-stock` 
   - Ensures stock cannot be negative
   - Automatically disables accounts when stock reaches 0

## Key Issues

1. **Database Connection**: Most of our test scripts show connection issues with MongoDB. The server might be trying to connect to a local MongoDB instance that's not running.

2. **Logging Configuration**: There appears to be no formal logging system set up. The server is using standard `console.log` and `console.error`, but logs may not be properly captured to files.

3. **Error Tracing**: Logs from stock decrement operations may not be visible because:
   - The MongoDB connection is failing so the operation isn't running
   - Logs are being written to the console but not captured in files
   - There may be errors in the purchase flow that prevent reaching the stock decrement code

## Recommended Actions

1. **Database Connection**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running when testing
   - Verify connection string in environment variables or config

2. **Improved Logging**:
   - Install and configure Winston or similar logging library
   - Ensure logs are written to files for easier debugging

3. **Transaction Safety**:
   - Consider using MongoDB transactions to ensure stock updates are atomic
   - Add more robust error handling around stock operations

4. **Testing**:
   - Create a local test environment with a test database
   - Implement unit tests for the stock decrement functionality
   - Create an end-to-end test that follows the complete purchase flow

5. **Stock Validation Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure validation happens at all entry points (API and UI)
   - Handle race conditions where multiple users might try to purchase the last item

## Implementation Verification

The code for stock decrement appears correctly implemented in `purcharseController.js`:

1. It checks for unranked items (`itemType === 'Unranked' || item.isUnranked === true`)
2. Gets the correct item ID
3. Calculates the new stock value
4. Disables the account if stock reaches 0

However, if the logs aren't appearing, one of these steps isn't being reached or executed.

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper logging with Winston
2. Set up a reliable test environment
3. Add more instrumentation to track the execution flow
4. Consider adding a webhook or notification system to alert for low stock
